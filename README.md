SKILLS I am a Data Engineer with a solid technical background and extensive experience in the field of data analytics and data science. My focus is on using tools such as Python, SQL, MySQL, and Tableau to design effective and efficient solutions. Additionally, I have worked with cutting-edge technologies like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where I have utilized services such as Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, Cloud Function, Pub/Sub, Generative AI, and BigQuery to develop and deploy advanced analytics solutions and artificial intelligence models in enterprise environments. My approach revolves around process optimization and generating actionable insights to drive project success.

Features Text Interaction: The chatbot interacts with users through text, analyzing their queries and generating relevant responses. Personalized Responses: The chatbot is programmed to answer a variety of common questions and provide useful information on a range of topics. Easy to Use: The user interface is simple and user-friendly, allowing users to communicate with the chatbot intuitively. Extensible: The code is designed in a modular fashion, making it easy to extend and add new functionalities as needed. Requirements Python 3.x Python Libraries: re (for regular expressions) and random (for generating random responses). You can install the dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Usage Clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory. Run the my_chatbot.py script using Python: python my_chatbot.py. Enter your questions and converse with the chatbot. Contributions Contributions are welcome!
